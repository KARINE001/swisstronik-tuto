# Contract challenge

In this coding challenge, your task is to transform the existing MessageBoard.sol contract into a PrivateMessageBoard contract. The goal is to create a private message board where only the owner of the contract (or individuals with specific permissions) can interact with it. This means they can write and delete messages on the board.

Hints:

1. To help you with this transformation, refer to the description and implementation of the PERC20 (Private ERC20) contract. This will provide you with insights into how to create a 'Private' contract with restricted access."
